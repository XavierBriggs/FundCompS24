User Perspective:
From the user perspective this program prompts the user to input the name of a text file or startup to load a set amount of personal sayings
into the programs database. After this is done the program prompts the user with a menu that has options for manipulating the inputed sayings. 
The options are display all sayings in the database, add a saying to the database, search for a substring in the database, and save all sayings
in the database to a new file. What ever option the user picks the program then responds accordingly and does what the user desires. 

Programers perspective: 
From the programmers perspective this program takes advantage of FILE pointers to allow the user to open a text file and then loads the strings
from the text file into a 2d char array that holds one saying per index. It uses the fgets function to read a string at a time from the userFile
and then stores it into a 1d array to verify input and finally loads it into the 2d array. For the different options the program takes advantage 
of the string.h library to calculate the stringlen, compare strings, loading new sayings into the database. The different options are each a different 
function with each option corresponding to one of the functions in the program. 

Checking: 
To check for accuarcy I tested my program with the provided executuble and startup file to see if my program would output a similar result which it did. 
I also tested my program by letting other people try the program to see if it resulted in the desired outcome.
